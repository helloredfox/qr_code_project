## My process

This project was fairly straightforward. To keep it simple, I didn't use any layout tools, framerworks or preprocessors. A short css stylesheet with a few type selectors and a single class selector were all that was needed. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- free google fonts


### What I learned

This was one of only a few times I've used Git and GitHub. I definitely have a lot more to learn, but I was able to learn about how to push project code to a GitHub repository, and how to publish a web page with their pages feature. 


### Continued development

This project doesn't have too many differences between a mobile and desktop design, but a mobile-first approach to web development will definitely be something I want to try and practice in the future. I could use CSS variables to reduce the number of times I coded the colors. I also think the semantic markup could be improved. As I was reviewing the HTML, I noticed that this qr code card could be independently distributable, and thus would be better suited to be in an article tag than a section tag.
